# Chess Engine 101: Prelude

In this series (if you can call it that) - you’ll be making your very own chess engine (a computer program that plays chess)! We’ll be dissecting how to build the engine, exploring CS and programming concepts in the process. Our goal is to have you walk away from this series with an awesome chess engine and some knowledge that can be applied outside of coding this engine.

⚠️ The code templates in this series is merely a _suggestion_, you may choose to follow it to the letter or not follow it all. The templates will be in Python and Java since they’re the most popular languages but if you would like to use some other language (C/C++, JavaScript, etc..) you may (although you’ll need to translate the templates over if you want to follow along with the tutorial and some code won’t be 1-1 mappings).
